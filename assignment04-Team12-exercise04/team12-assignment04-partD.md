# Assignment Part D (OPTIONAL): Model-based System Testing

The [state machine of the lifecycle of a bug](http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.4/en/html/lifecycle.html) is directly translated to the model `BugLifecycleModel` with guard methods to avoid illegal state transitions. This model was then extended with an adaptor `BugAdaptor` to get to `BugLifecycleModelWithAdaptor` which allows the use of `PageObject`s. The `PageObject`s from the previous part were adapted slightly in order to allow changing the bug status. The implementation of the `PageObject`s is still not complete in that not all possible buttons can be clicked in all possible states of the page etc., but the assumption is made that this is not necessary for the tests and thus not useful. The actual test generation, based on the model and running those tests is then done in `BugLifecycleTest.java`. Because these tests operate on [landfill](https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-4.4-branch/) and the reset of the bug is implemented as the creation of a new bug, the number of generated tests is kept pretty low.
